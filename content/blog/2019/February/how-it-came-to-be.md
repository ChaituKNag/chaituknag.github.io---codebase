## The thought

For many years, I thought blogging was cool, but never bothered to take it seriously. A little blog-post here and there, then wind it up and put it up in the attic.

But recently, I noticed people writing technical blogs in [Medium](https://medium.com) and [Dev.to](https://dev.to). They look both professional and at the same time, so cool to read.

```
yarn global add gatsby-cli

```

## Arrow function

This is pretty simple. Here is the syntax:

```javascript{numberLines: true}
const func = () => {
    return null;
}
```
